🌸 Iris Dataset Extraction & CSV Export

This project demonstrates a simple data preparation workflow using the classic Iris dataset from Scikit-learn. The objective is to load the dataset, convert it into a Pandas DataFrame, and export it as a CSV file for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

The Iris dataset is one of the most widely used datasets in data science and machine learning for classification problems and visualization examples.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers across three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Each sample includes the following features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

🎯 Project Objective

✔ Load the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn
✔ Convert the dataset into a structured Pandas DataFrame
✔ Export the dataset into a CSV file (iris.csv)

This workflow is commonly required in:

Machine learning projects

Data preprocessing pipelines

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Academic exercises & interviews

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data manipulation & DataFrame creation

Scikit-learn – Dataset source

🚀 Implementation

The script performs the following steps:

Load the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn

Create a Pandas DataFrame with feature names

Append the target variable (species)

Save the dataset as a CSV file
